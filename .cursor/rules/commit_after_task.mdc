# Commit After Task Completion

After successfully completing a task (e.g., one outlined in [prd/tasks.md](mdc:prd/tasks.md) or a sub-task discussed during our session), please remember to commit the changes.

This ensures that our work is saved incrementally and helps maintain a clean version history, aligning with good Git practices and Git Flow methodology.
