## How to Use These Journals

### When Facing a Bug
1. **Search existing journals** for similar symptoms or patterns
2. **Follow documented troubleshooting strategies** before reinventing approaches
3. **Apply prevention strategies** from related issues

### After Fixing a Bug
1. **Create a new journal** following the required structure
2. **Focus on the journey** - how you found the solution, not just what it was
3. **Include prevention strategies** to help others avoid the same issue
4. **Document time investment** to help improve debugging efficiency

### During Code Reviews
1. **Reference relevant journals** when reviewing similar patterns
2. **Check for prevention strategies** documented in past issues
3. **Suggest journal creation** for complex bug fixes
